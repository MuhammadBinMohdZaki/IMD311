I started my schooling era with my parents enrolling me in a kindergarten called
<b>"Tabika Perpaduan"</b>. In that kindergarten, I was a student who listened to the 
teacher and became one of the outstanding students. In addition, the teachers 
are very kind. They teach in a way that is easy for students to understand.</font></pre></td>

Starting school in primary school in <b>"Sekolah Kebangsaan Kampung Dato' Seri 
Kamaruddin"</b>, I was actually a bit naughty. Sometimes I make mistakes such as not 
completing schoolwork, skipping school, and not focusing in class. However, I was 
so active in school sports that I was awarded the school sportsman. All the 
teachers knew me with that status, but my studies were a bit down. In the 6th 
grade, I decided to divide my time well, and I finally managed to balance sports 
and my academics.</font></pre></td>

When I was in grade 1 to grade 6, I attended religious school in the evening at 
<b>"Sekolah Rendah Agama Rakyat Nurul Iman"</b> because I had to attend the "Sekolah 
Kebangsaan" in the morning. Here, I learned to be a perfect follower of Islam. 
All ustaz and ustazah are very kind and teach us sincerely. Their morals do not 
need to be discussed anymore, they are very compliant with the teachings of Islam.</font></pre></td>

In secondary school, I was enrolled at <b>"Sekolah Menengah Kampung Dato' Seri 
Kamaruddin".</b> During my stay here, I was able to meet new friends. However, 
many of my primary school friends are also registered at this high school so it is 
quite easy for me to fit in there. I was not very active in high school, but was 
still involved in several sports activities up to the national level to represent 
my state. I am also one of the top students in the school in 2020.</font></pre></td>

I continued my studies at <b>"Universiti Teknologi MARA in Kedah"</b>. I am a student 
in the Faculty of Information Management. Here I met new friends, but for me my school 
friends were irreplaceable. Next, the lecturers are quite firm and some also understand 
the students' situation very well. This is because there are many lecturers who used to 
be former UiTM students as well. I know the lessons I get will be a valuable thing for 
me, but for me the experience I got here taught me more to be a more useful person in 
the future.</font></pre></td>
